Thoroughly resuspend the Dynabeads magnetic beads in the vial (vortex \u003e30 sec or tilt and rotate 5 min). Transfer 50 μL (2 mg) Dynabeads™ magnetic beads to a microcentrifuge tube. Place the tube on a magnet for 2 min. Aspirate and discard the supernatant. Add 700 μL of lysed sample (prepared in 1X Binding/Wash Buffer) to beads. Mix well. Incubate on a roller for 5 min at room temperature (or colder if the protein is unstable at room temperature). The incubation time may be increased up to 10 min. Place the tube on the magnet for 2 min, then discard the supernatant. Wash the beads 4 times with 300 μL 1X Binding/Wash Buffer by placing the tube on a magnet for 2 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the beads thoroughly between each washing step. If the protein is to be eluted, proceed to step 7. To use bead/protein complexes in other applications, resuspend the bead/protein complex in a suitable volume of 1X Pull-down Buffer (or other buffer compatible with your downstream application). If you wish to continue with Pull-down, continue to step 1 in “Protein pull-down” (see page 2). Add 750 μL His-Elution Buffer. Incubate the suspension on a roller for 5 min at room temperature (or colder if the protein is unstable at room temperature). Apply on the magnet for 2 min and transfer the supernatant containing the eluted histidine-tagged protein to a clean tube. Current work is focused on improving quality of extraction by adding imidazole to washing steps.
